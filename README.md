## Synopsis

A Tribute Page - Bruce Lee

This is my first project thru Free Code Camp. It is a one page static tribute page to the late great Bruce Lee; made
 completely responsive using the Yahoo Pure Framework.

## Motivation

I am doing this project as a part of the Free Code Camp curriculum and to help build up my portfolio on my website and to
 receive feedback from the developer community.

## Installation

This project will be installed on github and codepen.

## Tests

I will test the site myself in different browsers and devices.  I will also conduct various speed tests.

## Contributors

This is a solo project and no other contributors will be needed for this project.
